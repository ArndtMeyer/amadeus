## Projects Involved
- [Eclipse Agemo](https://github.com/eclipse-chariott/Agemo): Agemo incorporates a Pub Sub Service, a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) service that facilitates publish/subscribe operations for in-vehicle applications, including but not limited to Eclipse Ibeji and Eclipse Chariott. This service has the capability to register with Chariott, enhancing its discoverability by other applications such as Eclipse Ibeji. It offers dynamic creation and management of topics.

- [Eclipse Ankaios](https://eclipse-ankaios.github.io/ankaios/0.1/): <DESCRIPTION>

- [Eclipse BlueChi](https://github.com/containers/bluechi): <DESCRIPTION>

- [Eclipse Chariott](https://github.com/eclipse-chariott/chariott): Chariott operates as a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) service, offering a unified interface for application interaction. Chariott enables [Service Discovery](https://github.com/eclipse-chariott/chariott/blob/main/service_discovery/README.md), allowing provider applications to promote their capabilities by registering with Chariott’s service registry. Consumer applications in need of specific resources and capabilities can discover them via Chariott’s service registry.

- [Eclipse Freyja](https://github.com/eclipse-ibeji/freyja/): Freyja enables seamless synchronization between the vehicle’s digital twin and its cloud-based digital twin. This synchronization allows for a consistent and unified digital representation of the vehicle across both platforms.

- [Eclipse Ibeji](https://github.com/eclipse-ibeji/ibeji): Ibeji is designed with the goal of enabling a digital depiction of the vehicle’s state and capabilities. It achieves this through an adaptable, open, and dynamic architecture that provides access to the vehicle’s hardware, sensors, and capabilities. This extensible framework allows for a comprehensive and accurate representation of the vehicle’s current status and potential functionalities.
