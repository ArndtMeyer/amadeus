# Maestro Challenge üöóüíªüé∂
Do you want to be the next maestro of the next generation of vehicle software? The time is now!

Imagine yourself as the **maestro** you have lines of code. You are not just writing code. You are composing a masterpiece that will drive the future of transportation. Your work will ensure that every component, from the engine control unit to the infotainment system, works in perfect harmony. So, step up to the podium, take a deep breath, and let your creativity flow. The stage is set for you to become the maestro of in-vehicle software! üöóüíªüé∂.

## About
Come hack with us, and create an in-vehicle application that will leverage an software orchestrators to build scenarios!

## Projects Involved
- [Eclipse Agemo](https://github.com/eclipse-chariott/Agemo): Agemo incorporates a Pub Sub Service, a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) service that facilitates publish/subscribe operations for in-vehicle applications, including but not limited to Eclipse Ibeji and Eclipse Chariott. This service has the capability to register with Chariott, enhancing its discoverability by other applications such as Eclipse Ibeji. It offers dynamic creation and management of topics.

- [Eclipse Ankaios](https://eclipse-ankaios.github.io/ankaios/0.1/): <DESCRIPTION>

- [Eclipse BlueChi](https://github.com/containers/bluechi): <DESCRIPTION>

- [Eclipse Chariott](https://github.com/eclipse-chariott/chariott): Chariott operates as a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) service, offering a unified interface for application interaction. Chariott enables [Service Discovery](https://github.com/eclipse-chariott/chariott/blob/main/service_discovery/README.md), allowing provider applications to promote their capabilities by registering with Chariott‚Äôs service registry. Consumer applications in need of specific resources and capabilities can discover them via Chariott‚Äôs service registry.

- [Eclipse Freyja](https://github.com/eclipse-ibeji/freyja/): Freyja enables seamless synchronization between the vehicle‚Äôs digital twin and its cloud-based digital twin. This synchronization allows for a consistent and unified digital representation of the vehicle across both platforms.

- [Eclipse Ibeji](https://github.com/eclipse-ibeji/ibeji): Ibeji is designed with the goal of enabling a digital depiction of the vehicle‚Äôs state and capabilities. It achieves this through an adaptable, open, and dynamic architecture that provides access to the vehicle‚Äôs hardware, sensors, and capabilities. This extensible framework allows for a comprehensive and accurate representation of the vehicle‚Äôs current status and potential functionalities.
