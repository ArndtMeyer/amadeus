Do you want to be the next maestro of the next generation of vehicle software? The time is now!

Imagine yourself as the **maestro**. You are not just writing code. You are composing a masterpiece that will drive the future of transportation. Your work will ensure that every component, from the engine control unit to the infotainment system, works in perfect harmony. So, step up to the podium, take a deep breath, and let your creativity flow. The stage is set for you to become the maestro of in-vehicle software üöóüíªüé∂.

Come hack with us!

## About

We supply an in-vehicle stack with software orchestrators. Your assignment is to utilize our in-vehicle stack and software orchestrators to construct your own scenario or replicate the scenarios provided in our [Sample Scenarios](#sample-scenarios).

The tech stack in this challenge showcases complex in-vehicle services and workloads, utilizing the vehicle‚Äôs computing resources and capabilities, as well as other in-vehicle applications. We provide two software orchestrators, Ankaios and BlueChi, to orchestrate the in-vehicle stack. Feel free to choose either for this hackathon challenge.

Enjoy the process of bringing your vision to life!

### BlueChi

The in-vehicle stack comprises Eclipse Ibeji, Eclipse Agemo, Eclipse Freyja, and Eclipse Chariott. This stack enables a universal vehicle model to be used across different vehicles, dynamic management of vehicle signal topics for publishing and subscribing, synchronization and conversion of in-vehicle signals to a cloud-based digital twin, and the development of applications without the need for specific knowledge about the location of the resources they use.

Please explore the [Projects Involved](#projects-involved) section for a deeper dive into the projects that are part of this challenge.

## Sample Scenarios

Here is a list of potential scenarios your team could develop. Feel free to invent your own scenarios too. Let your creativity shine ‚òÄÔ∏è and have fun!

- The system detects that a smart trailer is being connected to a car. A signal is raised to the orchestrator indicating that a smart trailer provider is connected, and applications are required to manage the smart trailer and adjust the body functions and powertrain accordingly to ensure a smooth trip. You will have the opportunity to build this smart trailer provider and application.

- Leverage OpenAI to enhance the vehicle‚Äôs user experience. You could develop an application that uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model to power an in-vehicle virtual assistant.

- Consider using OpenAI to enhance our software orchestrators, effectively creating intelligent orchestrators! OpenAI could optimize workload placements across compute nodes and/or cloud based on factors such compute usage, memory usage, network coverage, and latency.

- Create a web user interface application, such as a dashboard, that displays the various workloads' health.

## Projects Involved

### In-Vehicle Stack
- [Eclipse Agemo](https://github.com/eclipse-chariott/Agemo): Agemo incorporates a Pub Sub Service, a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) service that facilitates publish/subscribe operations for in-vehicle applications, including but not limited to Eclipse Ibeji and Eclipse Chariott. This service has the capability to register with Chariott, enhancing its discoverability by other applications such as Eclipse Ibeji. It offers dynamic creation and management of topics.

- [Eclipse Chariott](https://github.com/eclipse-chariott/chariott): Chariott operates as a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) service, offering a unified interface for application interaction. Chariott enables [Service Discovery](https://github.com/eclipse-chariott/chariott/blob/main/service_discovery/README.md), allowing provider applications to promote their capabilities by registering with Chariott‚Äôs service registry. Consumer applications in need of specific resources and capabilities can discover them via Chariott‚Äôs service registry.

- [Eclipse Freyja](https://github.com/eclipse-ibeji/freyja/): Freyja enables seamless synchronization between the vehicle‚Äôs digital twin and its cloud-based digital twin. This synchronization allows for a consistent and unified digital representation of the vehicle across both platforms.

- [Eclipse Ibeji](https://github.com/eclipse-ibeji/ibeji): Ibeji is designed with the goal of enabling a digital depiction of the vehicle‚Äôs state and capabilities. It achieves this through an adaptable, open, and dynamic architecture that provides access to the vehicle‚Äôs hardware, sensors, and capabilities. This extensible framework allows for a comprehensive and accurate representation of the vehicle‚Äôs current status and potential functionalities.


### In-Vehicle Software Orchestrators
- [Eclipse Ankaios](https://eclipse-ankaios.github.io/ankaios): Ankaios provides workload and container orchestration for automotive High Performance Computing (HPC) software . While it can be used for various fields of applications, it is developed from scratch for automotive use cases and provides a slim yet powerful solution to manage containerized applications. It supports various container runtimes with Podman as the first one, but other container runtimes and even native applications can be supported. Eclipse Ankaios is independent of existing communication frameworks like SOME/IP, DDS, or REST API.

- [Eclipse BlueChi](https://github.com/containers/bluechi): BlueChi is a systemd service controller intended for multi-node environments with a predefined number of nodes and with a focus on highly regulated ecosystems such as those requiring functional safety. Potential use cases can be found in domains such as transportation, where services need to be controlled across different edge devices and where traditional orchestration tools are not compliant with regulatory requirements.
